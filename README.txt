This text will explain how to set up and get started with the Test Analyzer Application

1. Install Python (pip install python or pip install python3)

2. Install the required dependecies (pip install pandas openpyxl flask flask-mail)
-pandas: processes excel files 
-openpyxl: reads xlsx files
-flask: builds the web interface
-flash-mail: allows for sending emails

3. Run the application (python3 app.py)

NOTE: In order for this app to work to the best of it's abilities, it's strongly recommended that you use a kahoot data file where the students use their MIX username for their name.
